Irdyan Sages
============

The Irdyan Sages organization is a home for several user-made campaigns for [Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org). They tell the tales of great sages of Irdya (the world where Wesnoth is located) and are often divided into multiple chapters.

Installation of our campaigns
-----------------------------

Ideally, the campaign you are interested in is available for your version of Wesnoth. If it is the case, you can download the campaign from in-game's add-on manager. But please, take note that it is not necessarily the latest version of the campaign. We usually maintain our campaigns only for the latest stable (and possibly development) version of Wesnoth, older stable versions only receive updates for a limited time once a new stable version is released.

If the campaign is not (yet) available for your version of Wesnoth, you can clone the campaign's repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com). This also allows you to try out changes in the campaign before they are released.

Docker images
-------------

Besides our user-made content for Wesnoth, we also provide a [docker image of Battle for Wesnoth](https://hub.docker.com/r/konecnyjakub/wesnoth).
